    "\n",
    "- The higher the spending range, the lower the overall passing score seems to drop.\n",
    "- Schools that have smaller student sizes (Small or Medium) seem to yield better test resulst across the board.\n",
    "- Per school type, it is shown that Charter schools yield higher test scores than District schools (Overall: 90.4% vs. 53.6%).\n",
